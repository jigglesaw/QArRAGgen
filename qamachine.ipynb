      "   How Do You Analyze a Mutual Fund's Performance?  \n",
      "\n",
      "You analyze mutual funds by weighting the stocks in the fund by sector and then determining management's contribution. You'll need understand some of the fund's inner workings before diving into an analysis, then work through several steps to reach the results that indicate management's contribution to a fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "\n",
      "Mutual funds are usually analyzed by weighting stocks by sector and figuring out how much management contributed to the portfolio.There are several steps involved in analyzing a mutual fund portfolio, including understanding the fund's design.Most mutual funds are designed to follow a specific strategy, such as aggressive growth or moderate risk.Analyzing a mutual fund allows you to see whether management's investing decisions have paid off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   Understanding Mutual Fund Portfolio Analysis  \n",
      "\n",
      "To understand a mutual fund, you'll need to learn how it is supposed to operate. This information is usually in its prospectus and describes its mandates. In this document, you'll also find the sectors it invests in and how much of the portfolio is dedicated to each. You may or may not be able to find information on how a manager picks stocks for the fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Investment Mandates  \n",
      "\n",
      "All mutual funds have a stated investment mandate specifying whether the fund will invest in large or small companies and whether those companies exhibit growth or value characteristics. It is assumed that the mutual fund manager will adhere to the stated investment objective. It's a good start to understand the fund's specific investment mandate, but there is more to fund performance that can only be revealed by digging a bit deeper into the fund's portfolio over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Sector Weights  \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, fund managers will gravitate toward certain sectors either because they have deeper experience within them or the characteristics they look for in companies force them into certain industries. A reliance on a particular sector may leave a manager with limited possibilities if they have not broadened their investment net. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine a fund's sector weight, it helps to use analytical software or sources like Yahoo or MSN. Regardless of how the information is obtained, you must compare the fund to its relevant indexes to determine where the fund manager increased or decreased their allocation to specific sectors relative to the index. This analysis will shed light on the manager's over/underexposure to specific indexes (relative to the index) in order to gain additional insight into the fund manager's tendencies or performance drivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The analysis can be as simple as listing the fund and relevant indexes side by side with a breakdown by sector. For example, for a large-cap manager, the simplest way to determine sector reliance is to place the fund's sector breakdown next to both the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Growth Index and the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Value Index. Both indexes exhibit unique sector breakdowns because certain sectors routinely fall into the value category while others fall into the growth category. Technology, known more as a growth sector, will have a higher weight in the S&P/Citigroup Pure Growth Index than in the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Value Index. Industrials, on the other hand, known as a value sector, will have a higher weight in the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Value Index than in the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Growth Index. A comparison of the fund relative to the sector breakdown of these two indexes will indicate whether the fund is in line with its stated mandate and reveal any over- or under-allocations to a specific sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The key to this analysis is to perform it on current and historical data to identify any tendencies the fund manager may have.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Attribution Analysis  \n",
      "\n",
      "There are fund managers who claim to have a top-down approach and others that claim to have a bottom-up approach to stock-picking. Top-down indicates that a fund manager evaluates the economic environment to identify global trends, and then determines which regions or sectors will benefit from these trends. The fund manager will then look for specific companies within those regions or sectors that are attractive. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A bottom-up approach, on the other hand, mostly ignores macroeconomic factors. A manager that employs a bottom-up methodology will filter the entire universe of companies based on certain criteria, such as valuation, earnings, size, growth or a variety of combinations of these types of factors. They then perform rigorous due diligence on the companies that pass through each phase of the filtering process.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to determine whether a fund manager is actually adding any value to performance based on asset allocation or stock picking, you need to complete an attribution analysis that determines a fund's performance driven by asset allocation vs. performance driven by stock selection. Attribution analysis can reveal that a manager has placed incorrect bets on sectors but has picked the best stocks within each sector. Using this example, this manager should have a bottom-up approach. If the manager's mandate describes a top-down methodology, this might be a cause for concern because you've discovered that the fund manager has improperly allocated the portfolio (using a top-down approach).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example of a Mutual Fund Portfolio Analysis  \n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a five-sector portfolio as an example: In the tables below, you see a comparison of a mutual fund portfolio with its relevant benchmark.

      "In the first chart, we see the sector weights for the fund's portfolio for each of the five sectors. The second column in that chart shows the return of each sector within that portfolio, and the third column calculates the contribution of each sector to the fund's total return (weight multiplied by return). Follow these steps:\n",

      "Calculate the contribution of each sector for the fund by multiplying the sector weight by the sector return. Repeat for the index.\n",
      "Calculate the rate of return for the fund by adding the sector contributions. Repeat for the index. In this case, the fund had a return for the period of 4.38%. The second chart shows the same calculations for the relevant benchmark. We could see that the total return for the benchmark was 3.555% and that the fund outperformed the benchmark by 0.83%.\n",
      "Calculate the overweight amount by subtracting the index (benchmark) weight for each sector from the fund (portfolio) weight for each sector.\n",
      "Calculate performance by subtracting the index return for each sector from the fund return for each sector. Notice that the fund had a 30% weight to Sector 1 while the benchmark only had a 20% weight. As such, the fund manager over-allocated to this sector, assuming it would outperform. We can see from the return of 4.2% for Sector 1 within the fund was 2% less than the return for the same sector within the benchmark. Now, this might get a bit tricky: The fund manager made the correct choice of allocating to Sector 1 as the sector for the benchmark had a return of 6.2%, the highest of all five sectors. However, the security selection within the sector was not very good, and, therefore, the fund only had a 4.2% return.\n",
      "Calculate the selection attribution by multiplying the benchmark weight with the difference in performance.\n",
      "Calculate the allocation attribution by multiplying the index return for each sector by the overweight amount.\n",
      "Calculate the interaction by multiplying the overweight column by the performance column.\n",
      "Combine the Selection, Allocation, and Interaction totals to get the Active Management Effect, 0.88.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The third chart shows the calculation of both allocation and security selection contributions. In this example, the manager's contribution to performance for overweighting Sector 1 was 0.62%, but the manager wasn't as successful in selecting securities, which resulted in a contribution of -0.4%.\n",

      "\n",

      "There are many other factors to consider when analyzing a mutual fund's portfolio. By analyzing the sector weights of a fund and the fund manager's attributions to performance, you can better understand the fund's historical performance and how it should be used within a diversified portfolio of other funds. You can also break down the portfolio into market cap groupings and determine whether the fund manager is particularly skilled at picking companies with certain size characteristics.\n",

      "Whichever factor or characteristic you want to analyze, the results can provide valuable insight into a manager's skill and further enhance the investor's portfolio construction process. Ideally, you would want a mix of good allocators and good stock pickers, as well as fund managers with different levels of expertise in certain sectors. This type of analysis, although time-consuming, can provide the information required to properly analyze a portfolio.\n",

      "\n",
      "You analyze mutual funds by weighting the stocks in the fund by sector and then determining management's contribution. You'll need understand some of the fund's inner workings before diving into an analysis, then work through several steps to reach the results that indicate management's contribution to a fund.\n",

      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "\n",
      "Mutual funds are usually analyzed by weighting stocks by sector and figuring out how much management contributed to the portfolio.There are several steps involved in analyzing a mutual fund portfolio, including understanding the fund's design.Most mutual funds are designed to follow a specific strategy, such as aggressive growth or moderate risk.Analyzing a mutual fund allows you to see whether management's investing decisions have paid off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   Understanding Mutual Fund Portfolio Analysis  \n",
      "\n",
      "To understand a mutual fund, you'll need to learn how it is supposed to operate. This information is usually in its prospectus and describes its mandates. In this document, you'll also find the sectors it invests in and how much of the portfolio is dedicated to each. You may or may not be able to find information on how a manager picks stocks for the fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Investment Mandates  \n",
      "\n",
      "All mutual funds have a stated investment mandate specifying whether the fund will invest in large or small companies and whether those companies exhibit growth or value characteristics. It is assumed that the mutual fund manager will adhere to the stated investment objective. It's a good start to understand the fund's specific investment mandate, but there is more to fund performance that can only be revealed by digging a bit deeper into the fund's portfolio over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Sector Weights  \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, fund managers will gravitate toward certain sectors either because they have deeper experience within them or the characteristics they look for in companies force them into certain industries. A reliance on a particular sector may leave a manager with limited possibilities if they have not broadened their investment net. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine a fund's sector weight, it helps to use analytical software or sources like Yahoo or MSN. Regardless of how the information is obtained, you must compare the fund to its relevant indexes to determine where the fund manager increased or decreased their allocation to specific sectors relative to the index. This analysis will shed light on the manager's over/underexposure to specific indexes (relative to the index) in order to gain additional insight into the fund manager's tendencies or performance drivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The analysis can be as simple as listing the fund and relevant indexes side by side with a breakdown by sector. For example, for a large-cap manager, the simplest way to determine sector reliance is to place the fund's sector breakdown next to both the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Growth Index and the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Value Index. Both indexes exhibit unique sector breakdowns because certain sectors routinely fall into the value category while others fall into the growth category. Technology, known more as a growth sector, will have a higher weight in the S&P/Citigroup Pure Growth Index than in the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Value Index. Industrials, on the other hand, known as a value sector, will have a higher weight in the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Value Index than in the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Growth Index. A comparison of the fund relative to the sector breakdown of these two indexes will indicate whether the fund is in line with its stated mandate and reveal any over- or under-allocations to a specific sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The key to this analysis is to perform it on current and historical data to identify any tendencies the fund manager may have.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Attribution Analysis  \n",
      "\n",
      "There are fund managers who claim to have a top-down approach and others that claim to have a bottom-up approach to stock-picking. Top-down indicates that a fund manager evaluates the economic environment to identify global trends, and then determines which regions or sectors will benefit from these trends. The fund manager will then look for specific companies within those regions or sectors that are attractive. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A bottom-up approach, on the other hand, mostly ignores macroeconomic factors. A manager that employs a bottom-up methodology will filter the entire universe of companies based on certain criteria, such as valuation, earnings, size, growth or a variety of combinations of these types of factors. They then perform rigorous due diligence on the companies that pass through each phase of the filtering process.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to determine whether a fund manager is actually adding any value to performance based on asset allocation or stock picking, you need to complete an attribution analysis that determines a fund's performance driven by asset allocation vs. performance driven by stock selection. Attribution analysis can reveal that a manager has placed incorrect bets on sectors but has picked the best stocks within each sector. Using this example, this manager should have a bottom-up approach. If the manager's mandate describes a top-down methodology, this might be a cause for concern because you've discovered that the fund manager has improperly allocated the portfolio (using a top-down approach).\n",

      "Here is a five-sector portfolio as an example: In the tables below, you see a comparison of a mutual fund portfolio with its relevant benchmark.

      "Calculate the rate of return for the fund by adding the sector contributions. Repeat for the index. In this case, the fund had a return for the period of 4.38%. The second chart shows the same calculations for the relevant benchmark. We could see that the total return for the benchmark was 3.555% and that the fund outperformed the benchmark by 0.83%.\n",
      "Calculate the overweight amount by subtracting the index (benchmark) weight for each sector from the fund (portfolio) weight for each sector.\n",
      "Calculate performance by subtracting the index return for each sector from the fund return for each sector. Notice that the fund had a 30% weight to Sector 1 while the benchmark only had a 20% weight. As such, the fund manager over-allocated to this sector, assuming it would outperform. We can see from the return of 4.2% for Sector 1 within the fund was 2% less than the return for the same sector within the benchmark. Now, this might get a bit tricky: The fund manager made the correct choice of allocating to Sector 1 as the sector for the benchmark had a return of 6.2%, the highest of all five sectors. However, the security selection within the sector was not very good, and, therefore, the fund only had a 4.2% return.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Understanding the fund's investment mandate: It is important to know the fund's stated investment objective and strategy, such as whether it focuses on large or small companies, growth or value stocks, and its sector allocations.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Analyzing sector weights: Comparing the fund's sector allocations to relevant indexes can reveal whether the fund manager has over- or under-allocated to specific sectors, providing insights into their investment tendencies and performance drivers.\n",

      "Question:  3. What is an investment mandate in mutual funds?\n",
      "Answer:  An investment mandate in mutual funds refers to the stated objective or strategy of the fund. It outlines the types of securities the fund will invest in, such as stocks, bonds, or a combination of both, as well as the specific sectors, regions, or asset classes the fund will focus on. The investment mandate also includes information on the fund's risk tolerance, target returns, and any specific investment restrictions or guidelines. It serves as a guide for the fund manager in making investment decisions and helps investors understand the fund's intended investment approach.\n",

      "Question:  4. How can you determine a fund's sector weight?\n",
      "Answer:  To determine a fund's sector weight, you can use analytical software or sources like Yahoo or MSN. Alternatively, you can find this information in the fund's prospectus or on the fund's website. Once you have the sector breakdown, you can compare it to relevant indexes to see where the fund manager has increased or decreased their allocation to specific sectors relative to the index. This analysis will help you understand the fund manager's tendencies and performance drivers.\n",

      "\n",
      "In attribution analysis, the fund's performance is broken down into two components: allocation attribution and selection attribution. \n",
      "\n",
      "Allocation attribution measures the contribution of asset allocation decisions to the fund's performance. It calculates the return generated by each sector or asset class based on the fund's allocation to that sector or asset class.\n",

      "Question:  7. How is mutual fund performance measured?\n",
      "Answer:  Mutual fund performance is typically measured by comparing the stocks in the fund by sector and weight to their corresponding indexes or benchmarks. This involves analyzing the fund's sector weights and the fund manager's attributions to performance. By summing the results, you can determine the fund's historical performance and how it compares to its benchmark.\n",

      "Answer:  The success rate of mutual funds can vary widely depending on various factors such as the fund's investment strategy, the skill of the fund manager, and market conditions. It is important to note that past performance is not indicative of future results. However, according to the information provided, Vanguard's top 50 performers (by 10-year average returns) had an annual average return of 12.4%. This suggests that these funds have been successful in generating positive returns for investors. It is always recommended to thoroughly research and analyze a mutual fund before making any investment decisions.\n",

However, according to the information provided, Vanguard's top 100 mutual funds (by 10-year average returns) averaged a rate of return of 10.58% from September 2013 to September 2023.

      "   How Do You Analyze a Mutual Fund's Performance?  \n",
      "\n",
      "You analyze mutual funds by weighting the stocks in the fund by sector and then determining management's contribution. You'll need understand some of the fund's inner workings before diving into an analysis, then work through several steps to reach the results that indicate management's contribution to a fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Takeaways\n",
      "\n",
      "Mutual funds are usually analyzed by weighting stocks by sector and figuring out how much management contributed to the portfolio.There are several steps involved in analyzing a mutual fund portfolio, including understanding the fund's design.Most mutual funds are designed to follow a specific strategy, such as aggressive growth or moderate risk.Analyzing a mutual fund allows you to see whether management's investing decisions have paid off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   Understanding Mutual Fund Portfolio Analysis  \n",
      "\n",
      "To understand a mutual fund, you'll need to learn how it is supposed to operate. This information is usually in its prospectus and describes its mandates. In this document, you'll also find the sectors it invests in and how much of the portfolio is dedicated to each. You may or may not be able to find information on how a manager picks stocks for the fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Investment Mandates  \n",
      "\n",
      "All mutual funds have a stated investment mandate specifying whether the fund will invest in large or small companies and whether those companies exhibit growth or value characteristics. It is assumed that the mutual fund manager will adhere to the stated investment objective. It's a good start to understand the fund's specific investment mandate, but there is more to fund performance that can only be revealed by digging a bit deeper into the fund's portfolio over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Sector Weights  \n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes, fund managers will gravitate toward certain sectors either because they have deeper experience within them or the characteristics they look for in companies force them into certain industries. A reliance on a particular sector may leave a manager with limited possibilities if they have not broadened their investment net. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine a fund's sector weight, it helps to use analytical software or sources like Yahoo or MSN. Regardless of how the information is obtained, you must compare the fund to its relevant indexes to determine where the fund manager increased or decreased their allocation to specific sectors relative to the index. This analysis will shed light on the manager's over/underexposure to specific indexes (relative to the index) in order to gain additional insight into the fund manager's tendencies or performance drivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The analysis can be as simple as listing the fund and relevant indexes side by side with a breakdown by sector. For example, for a large-cap manager, the simplest way to determine sector reliance is to place the fund's sector breakdown next to both the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Growth Index and the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Value Index. Both indexes exhibit unique sector breakdowns because certain sectors routinely fall into the value category while others fall into the growth category. Technology, known more as a growth sector, will have a higher weight in the S&P/Citigroup Pure Growth Index than in the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Value Index. Industrials, on the other hand, known as a value sector, will have a higher weight in the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Value Index than in the S&P 500/Citigroup Pure Growth Index. A comparison of the fund relative to the sector breakdown of these two indexes will indicate whether the fund is in line with its stated mandate and reveal any over- or under-allocations to a specific sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The key to this analysis is to perform it on current and historical data to identify any tendencies the fund manager may have.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Attribution Analysis  \n",
      "\n",
      "There are fund managers who claim to have a top-down approach and others that claim to have a bottom-up approach to stock-picking. Top-down indicates that a fund manager evaluates the economic environment to identify global trends, and then determines which regions or sectors will benefit from these trends. The fund manager will then look for specific companies within those regions or sectors that are attractive. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A bottom-up approach, on the other hand, mostly ignores macroeconomic factors. A manager that employs a bottom-up methodology will filter the entire universe of companies based on certain criteria, such as valuation, earnings, size, growth or a variety of combinations of these types of factors. They then perform rigorous due diligence on the companies that pass through each phase of the filtering process.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to determine whether a fund manager is actually adding any value to performance based on asset allocation or stock picking, you need to complete an attribution analysis that determines a fund's performance driven by asset allocation vs. performance driven by stock selection. Attribution analysis can reveal that a manager has placed incorrect bets on sectors but has picked the best stocks within each sector. Using this example, this manager should have a bottom-up approach. If the manager's mandate describes a top-down methodology, this might be a cause for concern because you've discovered that the fund manager has improperly allocated the portfolio (using a top-down approach).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "   Example of a Mutual Fund Portfolio Analysis  \n",
      "\n",
      "Here is a five-sector portfolio as an example: In the tables below, you see a comparison of a mutual fund portfolio with its relevant benchmark.

      "In the first chart, we see the sector weights for the fund's portfolio for each of the five sectors. The second column in that chart shows the return of each sector within that portfolio, and the third column calculates the contribution of each sector to the fund's total return (weight multiplied by return). Follow these steps:\n",

      "Calculate the rate of return for the fund by adding the sector contributions. Repeat for the index. In this case, the fund had a return for the period of 4.38%. The second chart shows the same calculations for the relevant benchmark. We could see that the total return for the benchmark was 3.555% and that the fund outperformed the benchmark by 0.83%.\n",
      "Calculate the overweight amount by subtracting the index (benchmark) weight for each sector from the fund (portfolio) weight for each sector.\n",
      "Calculate performance by subtracting the index return for each sector from the fund return for each sector. Notice that the fund had a 30% weight to Sector 1 while the benchmark only had a 20% weight. As such, the fund manager over-allocated to this sector, assuming it would outperform. We can see from the return of 4.2% for Sector 1 within the fund was 2% less than the return for the same sector within the benchmark. Now, this might get a bit tricky: The fund manager made the correct choice of allocating to Sector 1 as the sector for the benchmark had a return of 6.2%, the highest of all five sectors. However, the security selection within the sector was not very good, and, therefore, the fund only had a 4.2% return.\n",
      "Calculate the selection attribution by multiplying the benchmark weight with the difference in performance.\n",
      "Calculate the allocation attribution by multiplying the index return for each sector by the overweight amount.\n",
      "Calculate the interaction by multiplying the overweight column by the performance column.\n",
      "Combine the Selection, Allocation, and Interaction totals to get the Active Management Effect, 0.88.\n",
      "Add the Interaction column to arrive at a total of -0.055. This will be entered into the Error row.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The third chart shows the calculation of both allocation and security selection contributions. In this example, the manager's contribution to performance for overweighting Sector 1 was 0.62%, but the manager wasn't as successful in selecting securities, which resulted in a contribution of -0.4%.\n",

      "\n",

      "There are many other factors to consider when analyzing a mutual fund's portfolio. By analyzing the sector weights of a fund and the fund manager's attributions to performance, you can better understand the fund's historical performance and how it should be used within a diversified portfolio of other funds. You can also break down the portfolio into market cap groupings and determine whether the fund manager is particularly skilled at picking companies with certain size characteristics.\n",

      "Whichever factor or characteristic you want to analyze, the results can provide valuable insight into a manager's skill and further enhance the investor's portfolio construction process. Ideally, you would want a mix of good allocators and good stock pickers, as well as fund managers with different levels of expertise in certain sectors. This type of analysis, although time-consuming, can provide the information required to properly analyze a portfolio.\n",
